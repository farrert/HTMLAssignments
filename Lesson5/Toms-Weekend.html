        <p>Well, last weekend started the same as most weekends do, working on Friday.  Nothing great happened here. 
            Although, I did get some pizza from Crusted Creations.  Just a small pepperoni pizza with garlic butter 
            and parmesan cheese on the crust.  When work was finally over I swiftly drove over to Tilley's for a
            couple after work beverages.  Stone Brewing Company is one of my favorites, so I went with one from them.
            I took these drinks over to my girlfriends place where we got to play plenty of Street Fighter II.
        </p>

        <p>I have been playing Street Fighter II for a couple decades, so I do not get angry at her only playing one character, 
            but I do feel like I should win more.  I still have plenty of training to do with most of the characters and am slightly 
            irked that I can not seem to teleport with Dhalsim yet, but we did fight to a draw.  The handicap system seems to work 
            out for us, it ensures that neither one of us keeps a winning streak for too long
        </p>

        <p>I meant to write more about the weekend as a whole, but I got a little side tracked.  Oh well, this is probably enough 
            writing, especially since my next class starts soon.  I will try to keep you posted on my teleporting progress.
