                                This is a game that I created in GDevelop that shoots you out of a canon and fly to the next island.  
                                Grab some feathers and stars, while avoiding incoming birds, to survive the two minute trip!

                                In this game you are left alone at your place of work, the local diner, and you have to 
                                satiate the patrons before they get angry at your bad service.

                                This game got its name from being far from finished.  MVP stands for minimum viable product, and
                                this game is primarily what I am creating to learn about the software I am coding with. There is 
                                some fishing at the beginning, but the game is my attempt at a classic RPG.
