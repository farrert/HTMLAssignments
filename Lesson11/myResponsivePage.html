                Inferno is a beautiful island with two large mountains in the north and multiple rivers flowing thoughout to make a dozen waterfalls 
                falling from the mountain tops.  The island is also covered with trees and flowers even some golden roses are beginning to bloom.  There is 
                a bit of a monster invasion starting to take over the mountains in the north, but the science lab is concocting a solution.  We are not sure 
                how or when this invasion will be quashed, but there is an awful lot of science going on over there.
